# Lab 1 - Set up your Fabric environment and storage, and explore data

In this multi-part lab, you'll:

- [Create a Workspace and a Lakehouse](https://scribehow.com/viewer/1a_Create_a_New_Workspace_and_a_Lakehouse__we3bAKiXQBW1ccOjuy3iCA?referrer=documents)
- [Create a shortcut to data](https://scribehow.com/viewer/1b_Create_a_New_Shortcut_in_a_Lakehouse__4hn1-73HS1Ckk9tEl1a5zQ?referrer=documents)
- [Explore data using the SQL analytics endpoint](https://scribehow.com/viewer/1c_Query_Data_in_a_Lakehouse_SQL_Analytics_Endpoint__8fuOKDMqSpW8Zu_msstRNw?referrer=documents)

These are the foundations of building the schedule builder in Fabric! You need to complete each of these 3 parts before moving onto the next lab, where we'll transform the data we just brought into our lakehouse using a shortcut.
