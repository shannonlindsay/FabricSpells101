## Resources specifically related to Power BI

If you'd like to learn Power BI as a complete platform, we recommend you check out the [Learning Paths associated with the Power BI Data Analyst Associate certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/power-bi-data-analyst-associate/?azure-portal=true) (scroll down to follow the self-paced learning). Many of the modules include hands-on labs where you'll be able to practice what you've learned.
