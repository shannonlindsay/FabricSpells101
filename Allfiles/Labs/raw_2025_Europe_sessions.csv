Despite Fabric‚Äôs promise to unify the data analytics experience, security remained siloed between different Fabric components, creating confusion about inheritance patterns and best practices throughout the data lineage. OneLake security addresses these challenges by implementing a logical, unified security model compatible with all Fabric engines. As a single hierarchical file storage system, OneLake eliminates data duplication and establishes a true bottom-up security approach where permissions configured at the data lake level cascade through the entire system to the end user. This session demonstrates how organizations can now centrally configure and manage RLS and OLS on structured data at the foundation level, with all Fabric items inheriting these rules consistently.

In this session, we‚Äôll explore how Fabric simplifies end-to-end Data Science workflows, focusing on Semantic Link, a transformative feature for SMBs and enterprises alike. By accessing and synchronising Power BI semantic models to OneLake through Semantic Link, businesses can unlock advanced analytics without needing an extensive data warehouse. We‚Äôll demonstrate how to implement the theoretical Data Science Process in Fabric. Starting with the ideation and hypothesis phase, we‚Äôll showcase data discovery of Semantic models using OneLake Catalog and explore options for synchronising Semantic Models, highlighting trade-offs in integration approaches and access methods. For data exploration and modelling, we‚Äôll use SynapseML and AI Functions to apply built-in GenAI for product segmentation, translation, and supplier reliability classification, enabled by Azure OpenAI. Next, we‚Äôll prepare data models with AutoML tasks like financial forecasting, showcasing its accessibility for new teams and efficiency for scientists. Finally, we‚Äôll showcase a scalable product recommendation system based on financial data, applicable across industries. To provide actionable insights, models must be effectively deployed. We‚Äôll demonstrate how to integrate the model lifecycle with your data pipeline, ensuring predictions remain relevant while monitoring trends and performance. Without a consumable layer, however, these models can‚Äôt deliver value. We‚Äôll show how to serve predictions through Power BI semantic models and reports while seamlessly integrating them into external applications using Fabric‚Äôs shortcuts, SQL, or GraphQL as well. By the end of this session, you‚Äôll learn to implement end-to-end ML workflows in Fabric, from hypothesis to deployment, and integrate insights into Power BI and beyond. Join us to see how Fabric simplifies ML workflows and drives impactful results with Semantic Link!"

As we begin a new era of data management, the speed of business, rise of AI and demanding stakeholder expectations require more than trusted data ‚Äî they require an evolution of how organizations operate, consume and deliver data at scale and velocity. Traditional MDM can not deliver on these requirements. Enterprises require a more modern approach with modern data management solutions that provide businesses with the ability to better collaborate, automate and accelerate the creation of new data products that keep pace with the demands of modern business. Semarchy is helping to usher in the new era of MDM. This session will provide a preview of Semarchy Data Management on Azure, which will be available through Azure Marketplace. Our solutions provide integration with VS Code for MDM model and workflow design in a DataOps/DevOps approach. We leverage Co-Pilot to accelerate engineering team productivity and collaboration (with granular design), and Git integration for version control. With our Fabric integration, users can not only mirror Semarchy golden records into Microsoft Fabric, but they can create a semantic model to golden records and enrich them with metadata created within Semarchy. You can also create Power BI dashboards based on enriched golden records and semantic models, game-changing capabilities that enable better dashboards with greater depth.

From rocket science to credit derivatives, a mind that could imagine it could implement it with nothing more than Excel formulas and cell references. But over time this has resulted in siloed, manual processes in ‚ÄúShadow IT‚Äù where some of the most valuable data and logic in an organisation is locked away in these files. But it doesn‚Äôt need to be like that! The promise of Microsoft Fabric is to bring all your organisational data into a single place, in a single format where it can be extracted, shaped, enriched and secured once for use in any tool. So, from an organizational perspective, there are many benefits of such a unified data platform. However, it‚Äôs not obvious how you would take an Excel-based process (or financial model) and bring it into a Power BI and Fabric environment. Perhaps it‚Äôs overkill to even consider such a move, and it‚Äôs potentially a significant business risk if those analysts used to working in Excel haven‚Äôt yet developed the different skillsets required for Fabric. In this session we will take a financial credit risk model in Excel and go through the thought process and workflow for bringing this into Power BI/Fabric including: Attendees will come away with a view of how to drive ‚Äúon the ground‚Äù business process transformation using Microsoft Fabric and ideas on how analysts used to Excel can think differently about the structure and re-usability of data, in order to take advantage of an enterprise level BI/Data platform."
