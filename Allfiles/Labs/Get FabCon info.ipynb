Learn how this solution addresses previous limitations and provides consistent security across your entire data estate. Agenda: • Historical challenges with Fabric security implementation • Limitations of previous security models • Introduction to OneLake security architecture • How OneLake security resolves inherited vs. overwritten permissions • Administrative benefits and simplified governance • Business value across organizations of all sizes Prior to OneLake security, Microsoft Fabric users faced significant challenges implementing consistent Row-Level Security (RLS) and Object-Level Security (OLS) across their data estates. Despite Fabric’s promise to unify the data analytics experience, security remained siloed between different Fabric components, creating confusion about inheritance patterns and best practices throughout the data lineage. OneLake security addresses these challenges by implementing a logical, unified security model compatible with all Fabric engines. As a single hierarchical file storage system, OneLake eliminates data duplication and establishes a true bottom-up security approach where permissions configured at the data lake level cascade through the entire system to the end user. This session demonstrates how organizations can now centrally configure and manage RLS and OLS on structured data at the foundation level, with all Fabric items inheriting these rules consistently. We’ll examine the practical implementation of this model, explore real-world benefits, and demonstrate how OneLake security delivers value for organizations of all sizes by simplifying administration while strengthening data governance."},{"0":"1049","1":"(Almost) Everything You Wanted To Know About Purview Data Governance","2":"https://www.sharepointeurope.com/events/almost-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-purview-data-governance/","3":"2025-09-16 15:30:00","4":"2025-09-16 16:30:00","5":"200 - Feature Orientated","6":"Microsoft Purview","7":"Admin & Governance","8":"T37","9":"Barney Lawrence, Simpson Associates","10":"1000","11":"FabCon2025EuropeVienna","12":"Microsoft Purview Data Governance delivers a broad set of tools to allow an organisation to ensure its data assets are discoverable, well understood, and trusted.

From rocket science to credit derivatives, a mind that could imagine it could implement it with nothing more than Excel formulas and cell references. But over time this has resulted in siloed, manual processes in “Shadow IT” where some of the most valuable data and logic in an organisation is locked away in these files. But it doesn’t need to be like that! The promise of Microsoft Fabric is to bring all your organisational data into a single place, in a single format where it can be extracted, shaped, enriched and secured once for use in any tool. So, from an organizational perspective, there are many benefits of such a unified data platform. However, it’s not obvious how you would take an Excel-based process (or financial model) and bring it into a Power BI and Fabric environment. Perhaps it’s overkill to even consider such a move, and it’s potentially a significant business risk if those analysts used to working in Excel haven’t yet developed the different skillsets required for Fabric. In this session we will take a financial credit risk model in Excel and go through the thought process and workflow for bringing this into Power BI/Fabric including: Attendees will come away with a view of how to drive “on the ground” business process transformation using Microsoft Fabric and ideas on how analysts used to Excel can think differently about the structure and re-usability of data, in order to take advantage of an enterprise level BI/Data platform."},{"0":"1140","1":"Scaling and Protecting Data Engineering in Fabric: Best Practices for Success","2":"https://www.sharepointeurope.com/events/scaling-and-protecting-data-engineering-in-fabric-best-practices-for-success/","3":"2025-09-18 14:15:00","4":"2025-09-18 15:15:00","5":"400 - Expert","6":"Customer Stories","7":"Customer Stories","8":"TH23","9":"Santhosh Kumar Ravindran, Microsoft; Ashit Gosalia, Microsoft","10":"1000","11":"FabCon2025EuropeVienna","12":"Ready to take Fabric Spark to production?

Let me help you with that. Over the past few years burnout has become commonly mentioned in conversations about work life balance, about work from home, about hybrid working, about returning to the office. As is often the case when a newer issue becomes a commonly used buzzword, it’s true definition and potential causes have become watered down. Even the description of the recognized symptoms, prevention and treatments has become diluted. The realities of dealing with burnout, both in the workplace and in our personal lives, have been lost in the smoke. In this session we will be reminded of what burnout actually looks like, how it is correctly defined, and how we can avoid some of the triggers. I will share my professional experiences with a variety of different symptoms and issues and introduce you to some of the approaches that I encourage people to use. You will leave this session having added tools to your toolbox that are relatively straightforward, hopefully memorable, and generic enough that they will apply to the majority of us."},{"0":"1146","1":"Workload Development Kit v2 - New capabilities that makes building a Workload a breeze","2":"https://www.sharepointeurope.com/events/workload-development-kit-v2-new-capabilities-that-makes-building-a-workload-a-breeze/","3":"2025-09-18 14:15:00","4":"2025-09-18 15:15:00","5":"200 - Feature Orientated","6":"Developer Experiences","7":"Microsoft Power Platform","8":"TH29","9":"Gerd Saurer, Microsoft; Teddy Bercovitz, Microsoft","10":"1000","11":"FabCon2025EuropeVienna","12":"Have you ever envisioned building your own extension for Fabric that could provide value to your organization?
