# Real-time Intelligence with Eventhouse

## Add a new Eventhouse and ingest data

Navigate to the "Fabric Tutorial xxx" workspace and click the "+ New item" button from the ribbon. Scroll down to the "Store data" section and select the "Eventhouse" tile. 

Name the eventhouse "MyKusto" and click the "Create" button. Once it is created, click on the "MyKusto" database in the KQL databases section of the window.

Add some sample data. Click on the "Get data" button, select "Sample" then select "Automotive operations analytics". This is a truncated database of New York taxi operations over a two year period, and the largest provided sample data set. This will take a few moments to load.

Expand the "Automotive" table to view the schema.

Click the "Query with code" button in the ribbon, then select "Show any 100 records". A queryset window will open with the correct query. Click on "run" and note the time it takes.

![alt text](assets/04_Realtime__query_speed.png)

Replace "take 100" in the query window with "count" and run the query. You should see that there are over 2 million records in the table.

## Create a Query Set for multiple sharable queries

The data explorer is handy, but if you're working extensively with KQL, you will likely want to use a purpose built client like Azure Data Studio or Visual Studio Code or the Azure Data Explorer client. Within Fabric, the KQL Queryset is a sharable version of the Azure Data Explorer client.

Navigate back to the workspace. Click the "+ New item" button in the ribbon, scroll down to the "Track data" section, and select the KQL Queryset tile. Name it "Taxi Queries" and click "Create".

![](assets/20240320_073318_image.png)

Select the"MyKusto" database created above, and click "Connect".

Delete the queries automatically added to the default tab. Note that you can add tabs to work with different queries efficiently, and when saved, others can work with this query set.

Click the Copilot button, and enter the following prompt: "*How many rides were there and what was the average distance? Group the results by day and pickup borough name?*"

Copilot should respond with the following query:

```PlainText
Automotive | summarize RideCount=count(), AvgDistance=avg(trip_distance) by bin(pickup_datetime, 1d), pickup_boroname
```

Click the "Insert" button below the response. Feel free to close the Copilot window. The query summarizes fares, passengers, and distances by borough name. Click on the "Run" button to run the query, and note the time required to run in the results window. It should be around 1 second.

## Build a materialized view

While running a summarized query against 3 million rows of data in under a second is good, more complex queries with elements like joins, etc, and larger amounts of data can present a performance challenge. If these query patterns are common, it is a good idea to build a materialized view.

While still in the queryset, add a new tab and add in the following code:

```PlainText
.create async materialized-view with(backfill = true) FareSummary on table Automotive { 
Automotive
| summarize Fares = sum(fare_amount), Passengers = sum(passenger_count), distance = sum(trip_distance) by Day = bin(pickup_datetime,1d), pickup_boroname
}
```

The "async" directive tells Fabric to process this command in the background, which is necessary to use the "backfill=true" option. Backfill tells Fabric to include all current data in the materialized view - without it, the view will only contain new data after it is run. Click on the "Run" button in the ribbon. The result will be an OperationId. This Id can be used to query the status of the operation.

Wait a few seconds and then refresh your browser window. Open the "Materialized View" node and you should see the new "FareSummary" view. Open the "FareSummary" Materialized view to see the schema.

Open a new tab, and simply enter the name of the view by double clicking on it in the explorer view. Click on the "Run" button. The first run is initialization, so run it a second time. It should run in less than half the time that the original query ran. Also note the number of rows returned.

## Create a Shortcut

Navigate back to your Fabric Tutorial XXX workspace and open your Lakehouse_FabXXX lakehouse. Click the "Get data" button in the ribbon, and then select "New shortcut". Select "Microsoft OneLake", and finally your "MyKusto" database.

![](assets/20241126_171353_image.png)

Click Next, then open the "Tables" node and select the "Automotive" table. Click "Next", and on the following screen, "Create". A shortcut is created in the Lakehouse that points to the data from the MyKusto data. We can use that data in a new semantic model and build a report on it.

Click the "New semantic model" button from the ribbon. Give it the name "Automotive", then open the schema tree and select the "Automotive" table. Once added, click "Confirm".

*Note: if the Automotive table doesn't appear as an option, open up the SQL Analytics endpoint for the Lakehouse, and wait for it to be added, then try again.*

## Build a Power BI report

From the semantic model, click on the "New report" button.

Close the filter pane, and add a stacked bar chart to the canvas. You may want to resize the chart to make it easier to see.

![alt text](assets/04_Realtime__stacked_bar_chart.png)

Add "pickup_boroname" to the Y-axis, and "fare_amount" to the X-axis.

Select the save icon in the ribbon and name the report "NYCCabs". Select the "Fabric Tutorial xxx" workspace and click "Save". Close the Power BI window.

![](assets/20241126_172938_image.png)

Navigate back to the "Fabric Tutorial xxx" workspace. Note that there is both a report "NYCCabs" and a semantic model "Automotive"created. Click on the "Automotive" semantic model.

Click the "Open data model" button in the ribbon.

From the ribbon, click the "New measure" button.

Enter the following in the editor:

```PlainText
Trips = COUNTROWS('Automotive')
```

Click "Enter" and make sure the new "Trips" measure appears in the Data section.

![](assets/20241126_173418_image.png)

Navigate back to the workspace, and click on the NYCCabs report.

Click "Edit" in the ribbon. Add a new card visual to the report, and add the new "Trips" measure to its Fields. When you add it you will see it shows 3M trips. Select Brooklyn in the chart and notice that the Trips card now shows 252K trips.

![](assets/20241126_173550_image.png)

Save the report and navigate back to the workspace.

## Create an event stream and output to KQL and Lakehouse

Navigate to the "Fabric Tutorial xxx" workspace and click the "+ New item" button from the ribbon. Scroll down to the "Get data" section and select the "Eventstream" tile.

Name your Eventstream "BikesFeed". Click the "Create" button. It make take a few seconds for the screen to load.
