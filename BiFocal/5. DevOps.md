# Source control with DevOps or Github

Fabric allows you to bind a workspace to a repository in Azure DevOp or GitHub. In this lab, we will set up version control for our workspace.

## Set up the DevOps service

Navigate to [https://aex.dev.azure.com](https://aex.dev.azure.com/) and select the "Create new organization" button. Use your tutorial account as the name, accept the defaults, change the hosting location to "United States", enter the Captcha code, and click "Continue".

*If you get an error at this point because you keep switching to another browser profile, go to edge://settings/profiles/multiProfileSettings and turn "Account based profile switching" off for the labs profile.*

Create a new project named "FabricLabs". Leave it as "Private".

Once the project is created, select the "Repos" node. In the bottom section, click the "Initialize" button to create this new repo.

## Connect the Fabric workspace to the repo

Navigate to the "Fabric Tutorial xxx" workspace.

In the ribbon, select "Workspace settings".

Select the "Git integration" node.

Click on the "Azure DevOps" tile for the Git provider and select your userid for the AAD account and click connect. Using the dropdowns, select the organization, project and repo created above. Select the "main" branch. Click the "Connect and sync" button.

> **Branches and Git**
>
> Typically you are not going to want to use the main branch for the workspace, but rather a specific branch. Then you can control what changes are merged back into main for your development workspaces.
>
> Your production workspace, which will typically be consumption only, will likely be tied to main as that is the source of truth and items that make it to the main branch have been vetted and approved ideally.

Note that a new column is added to the workspace, "Git status". After a moment, the values in the "Git status" column will be updated. Note that some items may be unsupported - this will change over time.

## Deploy Devops changes to the workspace

Navigate back to your Devops repo. Refresh the windows to see the changes.

Open the Thermostat report 1.Report node, and select the report.json file.

Click the "Edit" button in the upper right corner.

Scroll down to line 23, "displayName". Change the value ""Page 1" to "Main Page".

Click the "Commit" button.

Enter a comment, then click the "Commit" button.

Navigate back to the Fabric workspace, and click the "Source control" button in the ribbon. Note that it shows an unsynced item.

Click the "Update all" button. This syncs the changes from DevOps.

Open the "Thermostat report 1" report. Select the name dropdown in the upper left corner of the screen, and note that the name of the currently open page is now "Main Page".

## Sync workspace changes with DevOps

Click the "Edit" button to put the report into edit mode.

Double click on the "Main Page" tab at the bottom.

Change the name to "My Page" and save the report.

Navigate back to the workspace. Note that the Git status beside the report name shows "Uncommitted".

Click the Source control button. Select the change, enter a commit message (tempting to skip, but it's always a good practice), and click the "Commit" button.

> **Under the hood**
>
> From a Git perspective, this is doing a few things. It is adding files to stage them. This is typically done with a ***git add*** command. Then it is putting the staged items into a commit. This is typically don ewith the ***git commit -m*** command.
>
> It is then actually issuing a push back to the branch within the Git repo. This is typically done with the ***git push*** command.
>
> All three of those are wrapped into the commit button with the Fabric UI.

Navigate back to Devops, and open the report.json file again.

Note that the value of displayName has changed to "My Page".

Click on the "Commits" node, on the left and note the history.
